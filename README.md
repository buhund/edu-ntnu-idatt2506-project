# assignment_08_project

Multi-Platform To Do List App written in Dart using Flutter.

The design of the app is based on tried and true design patterns for notes- and To Do apps, seen in apps like Apple Reminders, Apple Notes, Google Keep, and Microsoft To Do.

Here be no triangular wheels, only round ones.

## Testing/Running the app

The simplest way to run the solution is to use an Android emulator through Android Studio.

Steps to run the app:
- Install Android Studio, Android SDK, Java JDK21, Flutter and Dart SDK.
- Unzip the file containing the source code into a suitable folder, e.g. `assignment\_08\_todo\_project`
- Open Android Studio, and open the folder where you unzipped the code as a new project.
- Set up an emulator device (Medium Phone, API level 35, Android 15 "Vanilla Ice Cream") and start it via Device Manager by clicking the "Play" button (green arrow).
- To run the app on the emulated device, press the large green "Play" button in the top right of the UI in Android Studio.
- The app should now be running on the emulator device.
- You can now interact with the app as you would on a physical device.
